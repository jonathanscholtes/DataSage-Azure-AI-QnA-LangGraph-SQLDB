# DataSage: Azure AI Question Answering System over SQL Data with LangGraph

![diagram](./media/logo_small.png)


## Overview

DataSage is a question-answering system over tabular (SQL) data, designed around agent-based workflows that facilitate seamless data exchange between AI agents and the user. It leverages Azure AI Foundry, LangGraph, Azure SQL DB, and Streamlit to enable natural language interactions with SQL databases, retrieving precise and contextually relevant answers powered by AI. The project is built off of the LangChain tutorial [Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/).

At its core, LangGraph orchestrates a network of AI agents, each responsible for a specific task—query generation, SQL execution, response summarization, and visualization. These agents pass data to one another, ensuring efficient processing before delivering insights to the user.

The system integrates Azure AI Foundry for model inference, Azure SQL DB for structured data storage and retrieval, and Streamlit for an intuitive front-end experience.

Additionally, the project includes Bicep scripts for automated deployment of necessary Azure resources, ensuring a seamless and reproducible setup.

## Agentic AI and LangGraph

### What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to operate autonomously, making decisions and executing tasks based on structured workflows and dynamic interactions. Unlike traditional machine learning models that simply provide outputs, agentic AI systems can iterate through multi-step processes, leverage different tools, and adapt based on the context of the task.

In the case of DataSage, agentic AI is used to:
- Understand and interpret user queries.
- Generate and execute SQL queries dynamically.
- Analyze retrieved data and summarize it in human-readable responses.
- Suggest appropriate visualizations based on query results.

### How LangGraph Enhances AI Workflows
[LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/) is a framework built on top of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) that enables graph-based orchestration of AI workflows. Instead of executing tasks in a linear sequence, LangGraph allows for:
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple tasks, such as query generation and data visualization, can run simultaneously.
- **State Management:** Ensures AI agents retain context across multi-step interactions.
- **Flexible Workflow Design:** Enables complex branching logic, allowing different AI components to collaborate effectively.

In DataSage, LangGraph is used to structure the AI workflow, ensuring smooth transitions between query generation, execution, response synthesis, and visualization. By leveraging LangGraph, DataSage provides a robust and scalable approach to AI-powered SQL interactions.


### LangGraph Workflow  

![diagram](./media/graph.png)

The diagram illustrates the **LangGraph-based AI workflow** in DataSage for answering SQL queries and generating visualizations:  

1. **Start (`__start__`)** → Initiates the AI-driven SQL query process.  
2. **Write Query (`write_query`)** → AI formulates an SQL query from the user’s natural language input.  
3. **Execute Query (`execute_query`)** → Runs the query and branches into two parallel paths:  
   - **Generate Answer (`generate_answer`)** → Summarizes results in a human-readable response.  
   - **Generate DataFrame (`generate_dataframe`)** → Converts results into a Pandas DataFrame.  
4. **Suggest Visualization (`suggest_visualization`)** → AI selects the best visualization type for the data.  
5. **End (`__end__`)** → Completes the workflow, returning both **text and visual insights**.

## Architecture

The architecture of DataSage consists of:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of DataSage is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for users to query and explore SQL data seamlessly. The UI is designed to be lightweight yet powerful, enabling both technical and non-technical users to interact with structured databases using natural language.

- **Backend:** Built with Python and LangGraph, the backend handles query parsing, SQL execution, and AI-driven response generation. This demo features a tightly integrated agent execution within the Streamlit application. For a more scalable and production-ready architecture, consider [Designing a Robust and Secure GenAI RAG Architecture with React, Python FastAPI, and Azure](https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/Azure-AI-RAG-Architecture-React-FastAPI-and-Cosmos-DB-Vector-Store)

- **Database:** Uses Azure SQL DB serverless, a cost-effective and scalable solution for storing and retrieving structured data. The serverless model automatically scales compute resources based on demand, optimizing performance and cost. This ensures seamless query execution and data retrieval without the need for manual scaling or provisioning.

- **AI Processing:** Azure AI Foundry offers a unified platform for enterprise AI operations, model development, and application integration, enabling chat completion, agent-driven intelligence, and model management. It enhances natural language understanding and response generation, ensuring accurate query interpretation and seamless AI-driven insights

- **Infrastructure Deployment:** Powershell and Bicep scripts deploy and configure required Azure resources.
